# coc-bot
A custom bot for my "coc?" discord community

# Clash of Code
"coc" stands for "Clash of Code",
which is a programming game, hosted by [CodinGame](https://codingame.com).

# Bot
The bot has some interesting features,
which help with hosting coc-events:
* Availability planning: each player can specify the time,
in which they will most likely be able to play. Then you can
plan a game by using the `/plan` command, and the bot will
calculate the perfect time to play with most players.
* Clash monitoring: When creating a clash, a real-life message
will be posted, which will provide vasic information about
the clash and its' players.
* Registration: you can connect your CodinGamer account with discord
* Roles:
  * You can specify a role for "playing", which will be given to any
user, who is registered and is inside an active clash.
  * There is also a role for "winner", which will be given to the top player
of each clash, and you can specify, for how long the role will be kept in
case of consecutive games.
* Create clashes: a new interface allows you to create clashes directly from discord.
